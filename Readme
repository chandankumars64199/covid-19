Data visualization using the concepts of exploratory data analysis the data from the data sets are vsualized and anlysis is done based on that visuals.Data cleaning some of the redundant columns have been removed from the data so that it becomes free from clutters 4. finally using the models we predict the future possibility of covid19.

Errors faced: fig.show() didn't display the plot: this problem was specific in the google colab environment and got solved when Kaggle was used for execution

Conclusion: Uisng the principles of Exploratory data analysis we can predict and analyze the pandemic which shook the mankind just from the comfort of our home using our laptop.
